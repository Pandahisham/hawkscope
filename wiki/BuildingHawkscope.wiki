= Building Hawkscope =

=== Prequisites ===
To build Hawkscope executable jar, you need:
  * JDK 6+
  * Maven 2.0.6+
  * SVN client (to get the source)

=== Quick build ===
  * Download JDK, install, set JAVA_HOME environmental variable
  * Download Maven, extract somewhere, add maven/bin to your PATH
  * Get a working SVN client (i.e. [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org TortoiseSVN] on Windows or simply sudo apt-get install subversion on Linux)
  * Checkout the source from http://hawkscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
  * Go to checked out folder with command line terminal (cmd.exe on Windows or any shell in Linux)
  * Run `mvn clean package`
  * The build result will be in target/ folder. Look for hawkscope-...-jar-with-dependencies.jar
  * That's it. You can run it by double clicking or with java -jar hawkscope-....jar 


=== Adding SWT native library to local Maven repository ===
Hawkscope uses Eclipse SWT native libraries for each os / arch. Library 
dependency is automatically selected via Maven profiles in pom.xml.
Current profiles are: win32, win64, linux32, linux64.
To install SWT native library to local Maven repository, find out your 
system architecture (i.e. if you're on Windows XP, it is most probably 32 bit, 
so your architecture would be win32), then install the appropriate jar from 
Hawkscope project's /lib folder. Refer to lib/install.txt to find the 
mvn install:install-file line that is suitable for you.
If you want to build Hawkscope and there is no profile for your operating system
and CPU architecture, you can create new Maven profile in pom.xml, download your
SWT implementation from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ and install it. Please 
feel free to contribute new profiles.

=== Packaging Hawkscope + dependencies into executable JAR ===
To build an executable jar, simply run: 
{{{
mvn clean package
}}}
The jar will be in target/ folder, named:
hawkscope-(version)-(os)-(arch)-jar-with-dependencies.jar

= Running Hawkscope =

=== Running Hawkscope from source folder ===
Running directly from source is good for debugging purposes. In console, execute:
{{{
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.varaneckas.hawkscope.Launcher -e
}}}

=== Running Hawkscope from executable JAR ===
Doubleclick the executable jar, or execute in console:
{{{
java -jar hawkscope-...jar
}}}
