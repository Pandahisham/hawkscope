== Hawkscope Settings ==
=== General ===

*Check for updates* - if enabled, Hawkscope will check for updates on startup and will add "Update Available" item in Hawkscope Menu if update is available. If you are behind a proxy, make sure HTTP Proxy is configured in Network Settings Tab.

*Reload delay (seconds)* - each time Hawkscope Menu becomes hidden, a menu reload gets scheduled. A reload detects new devices, new plugins, it also cleans up system memory. This setting defines the reload delay.

*Use operating system icons* - if enabled, Hawkscope will attempt to use the underlying Operating System icons when displaying files. This works quite well in Windows and Mac. Folder and Mac application icon support is coming soon.
