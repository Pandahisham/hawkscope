So, you want to write a Hawkscope Plugin? You are in a right place then.

== Anatomy of a Plugin ==
Hawkscope Plugin is a Java JAR file, which contains:
  * plugin.loader - a plain-text file with fully qualified class name of main plugin class.
  * Java Class that implements [http://hawkscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/com/varaneckas/hawkscope/plugin/Plugin.java com.varaneckas.hawkscope.plugin.Plugin] interface. For convenience, it is recommended to extend [http://hawkscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/com/varaneckas/hawkscope/plugin/PluginAdapter.java PluginAdapter], which allows you to implement only the functionality you will need.
  * Image resources in "images" folder. (optional)
  * Any other Java classes or resources. (optional)

Hawkscope plugins should be compiled with Java 1.5 compatibility.

== The Bare Minimum ==

    public String getName() {

    }

    public String getVersion() {
        return "1.0";
    }
}
