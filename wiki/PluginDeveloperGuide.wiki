#summary Hawkscope Plugin Developer Guide
#labels Phase-Implementation

So, you want to write a Hawkscope Plugin? You are in a right place then.
= Required Knowledge =
  * Core Java 5+
  * [http://www.eclipse.org/swt Eclipse SWT]

= Anatomy of a Plugin =
Hawkscope Plugin is a Java JAR file, which contains:
  * plugin.loader - a plain-text file with fully qualified class name of main plugin class.
  * Java Class that implements [http://hawkscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/com/varaneckas/hawkscope/plugin/Plugin.java com.varaneckas.hawkscope.plugin.Plugin] interface. For convenience, it is recommended to extend [http://hawkscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/com/varaneckas/hawkscope/plugin/PluginAdapter.java PluginAdapter], which allows you to implement only the functionality you will need.
  * Image resources in "images" folder. (optional)
  * Any other Java classes or resources. (optional)

Hawkscope plugins should be compiled with Java 1.5 compatibility.

`plugin.loader`
{{{
bare.MinimumPlugin

`bare/MinimumPlugin.java`
{{{
package bare;

import com.varaneckas.hawkscope.plugin.PluginAdapter;

class MinimumPlugin extends PluginAdapter {
    
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Bare Minimum Plugin";
    }

    public String getName() {
        return "Bare Minimum";
    }

    public String getVersion() {
        return "1.0";
    }
}
}}}

= Example Plugin =

You can browse [http://hawkscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/com/varaneckas/hawkscope/plugin/openwith/ Open With built-in plugin source] for a sophisticated plugin example. 

Another good example - [http://hawkscope.googlecode.com/svn/plugins/twitter/trunk Twitter plugin].

= Where to start? =
  # [http://code.google.com/p/hawkscope/source/checkout Checkout] or [http://code.google.com/p/hawkscope/downloads/list Download] Hawkscope source, analyze it. Read [BuildingHawkscope]. 
  # If you are using [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse], create an Eclipse project for Hawkscope source. Otherwise build a hawkscope.jar - you will need it for building your plugin.
  # Create a Java project in your IDE. If it's Eclipse, reference the Hawkscope project to your plugin's new project. Otherwise add hawkscope.jar to a list of referenced libraries.
  # Create a class that extends [http://hawkscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/com/varaneckas/hawkscope/plugin/PluginAdapter.java PluginAdapter].
  # Create a plain-text file named `plugin.loader` and put your plugins fully qualified class name there.
  # Code your plugin.
  # Build the JAR. (Compile the classes with Java 1.5 compatibility!)
  # Try it.

More documentation is coming soon.
